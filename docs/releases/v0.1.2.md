# Release v0.1.2

This is the third release of HTTP Status check. This release fixes the
restart behaviour of the jobs on failure. This will avoid the
`CrashLookBackoffError` that happens on the pods after the failure.

## Container images

The following container image has been released:

```bash
docker pull registry.sighup.io/poc/http-status-check:v0.1.2
```
